# Product Requirements Document: MCP System Refactoring

## Introduction/Overview

The current MCP (Model Context Protocol) system has grown significantly with the implementation of intelligent prompts and comprehensive tooling. Two key files have become maintenance bottlenecks:

- `src/mcp_prompts.py`: 842 lines containing 6 different prompt functionalities
- `src/mcp_tools.py`: 1,793 lines containing multiple types of MCP tools

This monolithic structure hampers code maintainability, team collaboration, and feature development velocity. The refactoring aims to decompose these large files into a modular, well-organized structure that supports scalable development.

## Goals

1. **Improve Code Maintainability**: Reduce file size and complexity to make individual components easier to understand and modify
2. **Enable Parallel Development**: Allow multiple developers to work on different features without merge conflicts
3. **Enhance Code Discoverability**: Create intuitive file organization that helps developers quickly locate relevant functionality
4. **Increase Testability**: Enable focused, modular testing of individual components
5. **Support Future Scalability**: Establish patterns that can accommodate new prompts and tools without structural debt

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Development Team Members

**Story 1: Feature Development**
- As a developer implementing a new prompt, I want to create it in a dedicated file so that I don't need to navigate through hundreds of lines of unrelated code.

**Story 2: Bug Fixing**
- As a developer fixing a specific tool issue, I want to quickly locate the relevant code without searching through a 1,800-line file.

**Story 3: Code Review**
- As a code reviewer, I want to see changes isolated to specific functionality areas so that I can provide more focused and effective feedback.

**Story 4: New Team Member Onboarding**
- As a new team member, I want to understand the system architecture through clear file organization so that I can contribute effectively from day one.

**Story 5: Testing and Quality Assurance**
- As a developer writing tests, I want to test individual components in isolation so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

## Functional Requirements

### R1: Prompts Modularization
The system must reorganize `src/mcp_prompts.py` into a `src/prompts/` directory structure:

1.1. Create `src/prompts/base/` containing shared prompt utilities and base classes
1.2. Create `src/prompts/exploration/` containing project analysis prompts (`explore_project`, `understand_component`, `trace_functionality`, `find_entry_points`)
1.3. Create `src/prompts/recommendation/` containing optimization prompts (`suggest_next_steps`, `optimize_search`)
1.4. Create `src/prompts/registry.py` containing the main `MCPPromptsSystem` class
1.5. Create `src/prompts/__init__.py` that exports the main registration function

### R2: Tools Modularization
The system must reorganize `src/mcp_tools.py` into a `src/tools/` directory structure:

2.1. Create `src/tools/core/` containing health checks and memory management utilities
2.2. Create `src/tools/indexing/` containing indexing, search, and analysis tools
2.3. Create `src/tools/project/` containing project and file management tools
2.4. Create `src/tools/database/` containing Qdrant and collection management tools
2.5. Create `src/tools/registry.py` containing the main tool registration logic
2.6. Create `src/tools/__init__.py` that exports the main registration function

### R3: Backward Compatibility
The system must maintain full backward compatibility:

3.1. All existing MCP prompt and tool registrations must continue to work unchanged
3.2. External imports of the main registration functions must remain functional
3.3. All API endpoints and functionality must behave identically to the current implementation

### R4: Shared Utilities Management
The system must properly manage shared utilities:

4.1. Common prompt building utilities must be accessible across prompt modules
4.2. Shared memory management and error handling must be available to all tool modules
4.3. Database connection and client management must be centralized and reusable

### R5: Test File Updates
The system must update all related test files:

5.1. Update import statements in existing test files to use new module paths
5.2. Ensure all tests continue to pass with the new structure
5.3. Create opportunities for more focused, module-specific testing

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Functionality Changes**: This refactoring will not modify existing prompt or tool behavior
2. **API Changes**: No changes to MCP protocol interfaces or external APIs
3. **Performance Optimization**: Focus is on code organization, not performance improvements
4. **New Feature Development**: No new prompts or tools will be added during this refactoring
5. **Database Schema Changes**: No modifications to Qdrant collections or data structures
6. **Configuration Changes**: No changes to environment variables or configuration files

## Design Considerations

### Modular Architecture Pattern
- Follow the principle of single responsibility for each file
- Use dependency injection patterns for shared services
- Implement consistent naming conventions across modules

### Import Management
- Maintain a clear import hierarchy to avoid circular dependencies
- Use relative imports within modules, absolute imports across modules
- Provide clean public APIs through `__init__.py` files

### Error Handling
- Preserve existing error handling patterns
- Ensure error messages remain clear and actionable
- Maintain logging consistency across all modules

## Technical Considerations

### File Dependencies
- `src/main.py` imports from both `mcp_prompts.py` and `mcp_tools.py`
- Test files have direct imports that need updating
- The refactoring must not break the MCP server startup process

### Module Registration
- FastMCP app registration must work identically after refactoring
- Prompt and tool discovery mechanisms must remain functional
- Import order dependencies must be carefully managed

### Development Workflow
- Phase the refactoring to allow incremental testing
- Ensure git history is preserved for critical functions
- Plan for minimal disruption to ongoing development work

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **File Size Reduction**: No single file should exceed 300 lines
2. **Module Count**: Each functional area should be contained in 1-3 files maximum
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% of existing test coverage
4. **Import Complexity**: Reduce maximum import chain length by 50%

### Qualitative Metrics
1. **Developer Productivity**: New developers can locate and modify specific functionality within 5 minutes
2. **Code Review Efficiency**: PR reviews focus on functional changes rather than navigation complexity
3. **Merge Conflict Reduction**: Multiple developers can work on different prompt/tool features simultaneously
4. **Documentation Clarity**: File organization self-documents the system architecture

## Open Questions

1. **Migration Strategy**: Should the refactoring be done in phases or as a single comprehensive change?
2. **Backward Compatibility Duration**: How long do we need to maintain the old import paths alongside the new ones?
3. **Testing Strategy**: Should we create integration tests specifically for the refactored module loading?
4. **Documentation Updates**: What level of architectural documentation should accompany this refactoring?
5. **Team Coordination**: How should we coordinate this refactoring with ongoing feature development in the MCP prompts system?
