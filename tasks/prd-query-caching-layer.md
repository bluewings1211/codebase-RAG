# Product Requirements Document: Query Caching Layer

## Introduction/Overview

The Query Caching Layer is a comprehensive caching system designed to enhance the Codebase RAG MCP Server by implementing intelligent multi-tier caching across the entire data pipeline. Based on architectural analysis, this feature addresses four critical performance bottlenecks:

1. **Query Embedding Generation**: Every search generates new embeddings via Ollama API
2. **Vector Search Results**: Similar queries re-compute expensive vector searches
3. **Project Context Lookups**: Repeated project/collection metadata queries
4. **File Processing Results**: Identical content re-embeds during reindexing

The primary goal is to create a seamless, high-performance caching layer that integrates with the existing service-oriented architecture while maintaining data consistency and security.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Eliminate Redundant API Calls**: Reduce Ollama embedding API calls by 70-80% for repeated queries
2. **Accelerate Response Times**: Achieve 80-90% faster responses for cached project information
3. **Optimize Memory Usage**: Implement intelligent cache management with existing memory monitoring
4. **Maintain Data Consistency**: Ensure cached data remains synchronized with code changes
5. **Enhance User Experience**: Provide instant responses for common project exploration patterns

### Secondary Goals
1. **Reduce Infrastructure Costs**: Lower external API usage and database load
2. **Improve System Resilience**: Provide fallback mechanisms for external service failures
3. **Enable Advanced Features**: Support for conversation context and intelligent recommendations
4. **Maintain Security**: Protect sensitive project information through encryption

## User Stories

### AI Agent Stories
1. **As an AI Agent**, I want to quickly retrieve previously computed embeddings for similar queries, so that I can provide instant responses without waiting for Ollama API calls.

2. **As an AI Agent**, I want to access cached project architecture analysis, so that I can immediately understand project structure without re-processing files.

3. **As an AI Agent**, I want to leverage cached search results for similar queries, so that I can provide consistent and fast responses to users.

### Developer Stories
1. **As a Developer**, I want the system to remember my previous project queries, so that subsequent explorations of the same project are instantaneous.

2. **As a Developer**, I want cached data to be automatically updated when I modify project code, so that I always receive current information.

3. **As a Developer**, I want the caching system to work transparently, so that I don't need to manage cache states manually.

### System Administrator Stories
1. **As a System Administrator**, I want comprehensive cache monitoring and metrics, so that I can optimize performance and troubleshoot issues.

2. **As a System Administrator**, I want configurable cache policies, so that I can balance performance with resource usage.
