# Product Requirements Document: Function Chain MCP Tools

## Introduction/Overview

The Function Chain MCP Tools feature will provide comprehensive function call chain analysis capabilities through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface. This feature addresses the critical need for code flow understanding and impact analysis in complex codebases by exposing existing `ImplementationChainService` functionality through user-friendly MCP tools.

**Problem Statement**: Developers, especially newcomers to a codebase, struggle to understand how functions interact and call each other. Additionally, senior developers need efficient ways to perform impact analysis when modifying code to understand which functions will be affected by changes.

**Solution**: Implement three MCP tools that provide function chain tracing, path finding, and complexity analysis with refactoring suggestions, all accessible through natural language inputs that automatically convert to breadcrumb format.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Enable AI agents to trace and analyze function call chains through intuitive MCP tools
2. **Secondary Goal**: Provide developers and system architects with comprehensive code flow analysis capabilities
3. **Tertiary Goal**: Deliver refactoring suggestions based on complexity analysis to improve code quality
4. **Usability Goal**: Ensure tools are easy to use with sensible defaults while supporting advanced configuration
5. **Accuracy Goal**: Provide reliable function chain analysis with clear feedback when chains cannot be found

## User Stories

### Story 1: New Developer Code Understanding
**As a** new developer joining a team
**I want to** trace the complete execution flow from an API endpoint
**So that** I can understand how data flows through the system and learn the codebase structure

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can input a natural language description like "create user API"
- The system automatically converts it to the correct breadcrumb format
- I receive a clear, arrow-formatted output showing the complete function call chain
- The output includes function names, file paths, and relationship types

### Story 2: Code Review Impact Analysis
**As a** code reviewer
**I want to** see which functions will be affected by modifying a specific function
**So that** I can evaluate the risk and scope of proposed changes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can specify both source and target functions using natural language
- The system shows me all possible paths between functions
- I receive information about path reliability and complexity
- I can understand which functions are most likely to be impacted

### Story 3: Architecture Analysis and Refactoring
**As a** system architect
**I want to** analyze the overall function call patterns in a project
**So that** I can identify complex areas that need refactoring and understand system hotspots

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- I can analyze function chains across entire projects or specific modules
- The system provides complexity metrics and identifies high-complexity functions
- I receive concrete refactoring suggestions based on complexity analysis
- I can see hotspot analysis showing frequently used paths

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **The system must provide a `trace_function_chain_tool` that traces complete function call chains from a single entry point**
   - Accept natural language input for breadcrumb specification
   - Support forward, backward, and bidirectional chain tracing
   - Return arrow-formatted output (e.g., `A => B => C`) as default format
   - Provide optional Mermaid diagram output format
   - Include depth control with configurable maximum depth (default: 10)

2. **The system must provide a `find_function_path_tool` that finds optimal paths between two specific functions**
   - Accept natural language input for both source and target functions
   - Support multiple path finding strategies (shortest, optimal, all paths)
   - Return multiple path options with quality metrics
   - Include path reliability and complexity scoring
   - Limit results to configurable maximum paths (default: 5)

3. **The system must provide an `analyze_project_chains_tool` that performs comprehensive project-level chain analysis**
   - Support scope-based analysis (e.g., "api.controller.*")
   - Generate complexity metrics based on: branches (35%), cyclomatic complexity (30%), call depth (25%), function lines (10%)
   - Provide refactoring suggestions for high-complexity functions
   - Identify hotspot paths and usage patterns
   - Generate coverage and connectivity statistics

4. **The system must include automatic breadcrumb resolution**
   - Detect whether input is already in breadcrumb format
   - Convert natural language inputs to breadcrumb format using shared internal service
   - Provide clear error messages when resolution fails
   - Support multiple candidate resolution with confidence scoring

5. **The system must provide comprehensive error handling**
   - Return clear error messages when functions cannot be found
   - Suggest using search tools for further analysis when chains are not found
   - Indicate whether the issue is missing implementation or insufficient search depth
   - Provide helpful guidance for resolving common issues

6. **The system must support configurable output formats**
   - Default arrow-formatted text output for all tools
   - Optional Mermaid diagram format for visualization
   - Include metadata such as file paths, relationship types, and confidence scores
   - Support both compact and detailed output modes

### Technical Requirements

7. **The system must integrate with existing Graph RAG infrastructure**
   - Utilize existing `ImplementationChainService` and `GraphRAGService`
   - Leverage current graph caching mechanisms for performance
   - Maintain consistency with existing MCP tool patterns
   - Support existing project indexing and breadcrumb systems

8. **The system must provide reasonable performance**
   - Respond within 2 seconds for typical function chains
   - Cache complex graph computations for repeated queries
   - Support concurrent requests without degradation
   - Handle large codebases (10,000+ functions) efficiently

9. **The system must include comprehensive parameter validation**
   - Validate project names against indexed projects
   - Ensure depth parameters are within reasonable bounds
   - Validate chain types and direction parameters
   - Provide clear validation error messages

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time code execution tracing** - This feature analyzes static code structure, not runtime execution
2. **Performance profiling** - No runtime performance metrics or execution timing analysis
3. **Cross-language analysis** - Focus on single-language projects, no multi-language chain analysis
4. **Visual UI components** - Text-based and Mermaid output only, no interactive visualizations
5. **Code modification suggestions** - Refactoring suggestions are advisory only, no automatic code changes
6. **Version control integration** - No analysis of code changes across different versions
7. **Backwards compatibility** - No requirement to maintain compatibility with existing APIs

## Design Considerations

### User Experience Design
- **Sensible Defaults**: All parameters except entry point should have reasonable defaults
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic functionality accessible with minimal parameters, advanced options available when needed
- **Clear Feedback**: Informative error messages and suggestions for resolution
- **Consistent Interface**: Similar parameter patterns across all three tools

### Output Format Design
- **Default Text Format**: Simple arrow notation for easy reading
  ```
  api.controller.create_user
  => validation.service.validate_user_data
  => database.user.repository.save
  => email.service.send_welcome_email
  ```
- **Optional Mermaid Format**: Structured diagram output for visualization
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[api.controller.create_user] --> B[validation.service.validate_user_data]
      B --> C[database.user.repository.save]
      C --> D[email.service.send_welcome_email]
  ```

### Error Handling Design
- **Graceful Degradation**: Provide partial results when complete chains cannot be found
- **Helpful Guidance**: Suggest next steps when analysis fails
- **Context Preservation**: Include available context even in error cases

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Integration
- **Shared Services**: Utilize existing `ImplementationChainService` and `GraphRAGService`
- **Breadcrumb Resolution**: Implement shared `BreadcrumbResolver` service for consistent natural language processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Leverage existing graph caching with appropriate cache keys for function chain results

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Build graphs only when necessary
- **Depth Limiting**: Implement configurable depth limits to prevent excessive computation
- **Result Caching**: Cache complex analysis results with appropriate TTL
- **Batch Processing**: Support efficient processing of multiple related queries

### Data Dependencies
- **Project Indexing**: Requires projects to be properly indexed with breadcrumb information
- **Graph Construction**: Depends on existing graph building infrastructure
- **Metadata Availability**: Requires function metadata including relationships and complexity information

## Success Metrics

3. **Complexity Scoring Reliability**: Consistency of complexity calculations across similar functions
4. **Documentation Coverage**: Percentage of tool features properly documented with examples

## Open Questions

1. **Natural Language Processing Scope**: How sophisticated should the natural language to breadcrumb conversion be? Should it support complex queries like "functions that handle user authentication in the API layer"?

2. **Cross-Project Analysis**: While not in scope for initial implementation, should the architecture support future cross-project chain analysis?

3. **Integration with IDE**: Should we plan for future integration with development environments, or focus solely on MCP interface?

4. **Performance Benchmarks**: What specific performance benchmarks should we establish for different codebase sizes?

5. **Complexity Weighting Calibration**: The proposed complexity formula (branches 35%, cyclomatic complexity 30%, call depth 25%, function lines 10%) - should this be configurable or fixed?

6. **Visualization Limits**: For very large function chains, should we implement automatic summarization or grouping to maintain readability?

7. **Caching Strategy**: What should be the appropriate cache TTL for function chain results, considering that code changes might invalidate cached chains?

8. **Error Recovery**: When breadcrumb resolution fails, should the system automatically fall back to search-based suggestions, or require explicit user action?
