# Product Requirements Document: Intelligent Chunking System Repair & Enhancement

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Codebase RAG system currently suffers from a critical issue where Tree-sitter parsers are completely non-functional, causing all code files to be indexed as whole-file chunks instead of intelligent semantic chunks (functions, classes, methods). This severely impacts search precision and code understanding capabilities.

**Problem Statement**: The intelligent chunking system that should parse code into semantic blocks (functions, classes, etc.) is failing due to Tree-sitter dependency issues, forcing the system to fall back to whole-file indexing for all programming languages.

**Goal**: Restore and enhance the intelligent chunking system to enable function-level and class-level code indexing, significantly improving search accuracy and code comprehension.

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Restore Tree-sitter Functionality**: Fix all Tree-sitter parser initialization failures
2. **Enable Semantic Chunking**: Restore function/class-level indexing for supported languages
3. **Expand Language Support**: Add C++ language support with intelligent chunking
4. **Improve Search Precision**: Enable users to find specific functions/classes instead of whole files

### Secondary Goals
1. **System Cleanup**: Remove invalid whole-file chunks after intelligent chunking is restored
2. **Error Handling**: Improve fallback mechanisms when parsing fails
3. **Monitoring**: Add diagnostics for chunking system health

### Success Metrics
- Tree-sitter parsers successfully initialize for all supported languages
- 80%+ of code files use semantic chunking (not whole-file)
- Search results show function/class-level granularity
- C++ files (.hpp, .cpp) are intelligently chunked

## 3. User Stories

### As a Developer searching for code
- **US1**: I want to search for a specific function name and get the function definition, not the entire file
- **US2**: I want to find all classes related to "authentication" and see individual class definitions
- **US3**: I want to search for C++ header files and see individual function declarations

### As a Code Reviewer
- **US4**: I want to quickly locate specific methods in large files during code review
- **US5**: I want to understand the structure of unfamiliar codebases by browsing functions and classes

### As a System Administrator
- **US6**: I want to monitor the health of the chunking system and detect parsing failures
- **US7**: I want to ensure the indexing system processes code efficiently without falling back to whole-file chunks

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Tree-sitter Parser Restoration
**REQ-1.1**: The system must successfully initialize Tree-sitter parsers for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Java
**REQ-1.2**: Parser initialization failures must be logged with specific error details
**REQ-1.3**: The system must gracefully handle Tree-sitter version compatibility issues

### 4.2 Semantic Chunking Capabilities
**REQ-2.1**: Python files must be chunked into functions, classes, methods, and imports
**REQ-2.2**: JavaScript/TypeScript files must be chunked into functions, classes, interfaces, and exports
**REQ-2.3**: Java files must be chunked into methods, classes, interfaces, and imports
**REQ-2.4**: Go files must be chunked into functions, structs, interfaces, and imports
**REQ-2.5**: Rust files must be chunked into functions, structs, enums, and modules

### 4.3 C++ Language Support Addition
**REQ-3.1**: The system must support tree-sitter-cpp for C++ file parsing
**REQ-3.2**: C++ files (.cpp, .hpp, .h) must be chunked into functions, classes, namespaces, and includes
**REQ-3.3**: C++ template definitions must be properly identified and chunked

### 4.4 Fallback Mechanism Enhancement
**REQ-4.1**: When semantic parsing fails, the system must log the specific failure reason
**REQ-4.2**: Fallback to whole-file chunking must only occur for unsupported languages or parse errors
**REQ-4.3**: The system must track and report the percentage of files using fallback chunking

### 4.5 Search Result Quality
**REQ-5.1**: Search results must include chunk type information (function, class, method, etc.)
**REQ-5.2**: Search results must show function signatures and class names when available
**REQ-5.3**: Context information must include surrounding code structure (parent class, namespace)

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **New Language Addition Beyond C++**: This phase will not add support for languages other than C++
2. **Advanced AST Analysis**: Complex code analysis like dependency graphs or call trees
3. **Real-time Parsing**: Parsing during search queries (only during indexing)
4. **Custom Chunk Types**: Creating new chunk types beyond standard language constructs
5. **IDE Integration**: Direct integration with code editors or IDEs

## 6. Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Tree-sitter Dependencies
- **Constraint**: Must use compatible Tree-sitter versions across all language parsers
- **Consideration**: Tree-sitter language packages may have different API patterns
- **Risk**: Language parser updates might break existing functionality

### 6.2 Performance Impact
- **Memory Usage**: Intelligent chunking uses more memory than whole-file chunking
- **Processing Time**: AST parsing adds overhead during indexing
- **Mitigation**: Maintain parallel processing and batch optimization

### 6.3 Error Recovery
- **Syntax Errors**: Files with syntax errors should still attempt partial chunking
- **Malformed Code**: Graceful degradation to whole-file chunking when necessary
- **Large Files**: Memory-efficient processing of very large source files

### 6.4 Backward Compatibility
- **Existing Data**: Plan for migrating existing whole-file chunks to semantic chunks
- **API Compatibility**: Maintain existing search API while adding semantic features
- **Configuration**: Preserve existing indexing configuration options

## 7. Design Considerations

### 7.1 Architecture Changes
- **CodeParserService Enhancement**: Robust Tree-sitter initialization with error handling
- **Language Registry**: Centralized mapping of file extensions to parser capabilities
- **Chunk Type Validation**: Ensure chunk metadata consistency across languages

### 7.2 User Experience
- **Search Interface**: Display chunk type information in search results
- **Debugging Tools**: Provide diagnostics for chunking system status
- **Progress Indicators**: Show parsing progress during large codebase indexing

### 7.3 Data Model Updates
- **Chunk Metadata**: Ensure all semantic chunks include proper type and context information
- **Collection Organization**: Maintain efficient organization by project and file type
- **Version Tracking**: Track which chunks were created with intelligent vs. fallback parsing

## 8. Success Metrics

### 8.1 Technical Metrics
- **Parser Success Rate**: 100% successful initialization of supported language parsers
- **Chunking Ratio**: >80% of supported language files use semantic chunking (not whole-file)
- **Search Precision**: 50%+ improvement in search result relevance for function/class queries
- **Error Rate**: <5% of files fall back to whole-file chunking due to parse errors

### 8.2 Performance Metrics
- **Indexing Speed**: Maintain within 20% of current indexing performance
- **Memory Usage**: Stay within current memory limits during intelligent chunking
- **Storage Efficiency**: Intelligent chunks should not significantly increase storage requirements

### 8.3 User Experience Metrics
- **Search Satisfaction**: User feedback indicating improved code discovery
- **Chunk Quality**: Manual verification of semantic chunk accuracy across languages
- **System Reliability**: Zero critical failures during normal operation

## 9. Open Questions

### 9.1 Technical Questions
1. **Tree-sitter Version Strategy**: Should we pin specific versions or use latest compatible versions?
2. **Partial Parsing**: How should the system handle files with syntax errors - attempt partial chunking or fallback entirely?
3. **Chunk Size Optimization**: What are the optimal chunk size limits for different programming languages?

### 9.2 Product Questions
1. **Migration Strategy**: Should existing whole-file chunks be automatically migrated or reindexed?
2. **User Notifications**: Should users be notified when files fall back to whole-file chunking?
3. **Performance Trade-offs**: Is the improved search precision worth the additional processing overhead?

### 9.3 Future Considerations
1. **Language Prioritization**: Which additional languages should be prioritized for intelligent chunking support?
2. **Advanced Features**: Would users benefit from cross-reference tracking between chunks?
3. **Integration Opportunities**: How might this enhanced chunking integrate with existing development tools?
