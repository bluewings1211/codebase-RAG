# PRD: Enhanced Explore Project MCP Tool with RAG Integration

## Introduction/Overview

The current `explore_project` MCP tool suffers from significant performance and quality limitations, relying solely on static file analysis without leveraging the intelligent codebase RAG system. This results in inefficient analysis that requires AI agents to perform redundant searches and provides limited depth of understanding.

This feature will enhance the `explore_project` tool by integrating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search capabilities, transforming it from a simple prompt generator into an intelligent project analysis system that provides both comprehensive analysis results and guided exploration recommendations.

The goal is to enable rapid, high-quality project understanding for new developers and AI agents by leveraging the existing vectorized knowledge base of intelligent code chunks.

## Goals

1. **Improve Analysis Quality**: Provide deeper, more accurate project insights using RAG-powered semantic search
2. **Enhance Performance**: Reduce project exploration time from minutes to seconds by utilizing pre-indexed knowledge
3. **Deliver Actionable Results**: Provide both immediate analysis results and strategic exploration guidance
4. **Increase User Productivity**: Enable faster project onboarding for developers and more effective AI agent interactions
5. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Maximize ROI on the intelligent code chunking and vector database systems

## User Stories

**As a new developer:**
- I want to quickly understand an unfamiliar codebase so that I can become productive faster
- I want to see the project's architecture, key components, and entry points in one comprehensive analysis
- I want guidance on where to start exploring based on the project's actual structure and patterns

**As a project maintainer:**
- I want to get an overview of my project's current state and structure so that I can identify areas for improvement
- I want to understand how different components relate to each other so that I can make informed architectural decisions

**As an AI agent:**
- I want to receive comprehensive project context immediately so that I can assist users more effectively
- I want both structured analysis data and exploration guidance so that I can provide relevant recommendations
- I want to understand function-level details and relationships so that I can give precise assistance

## Functional Requirements

### Core RAG Integration Requirements

1. **Pre-Analysis RAG Search**: The system must perform intelligent searches across the project's indexed codebase before generating exploration guidance
2. **Multi-Query Search Strategy**: The system must execute multiple targeted searches (architecture patterns, entry points, core modules, etc.) to gather comprehensive insights
3. **Intelligent Content Synthesis**: The system must synthesize RAG search results into coherent project analysis
4. **Function-Level Insights**: The system must leverage intelligent code chunks to provide detailed component analysis

### Output Format Requirements

5. **Mixed-Mode Output**: The system must provide both immediate analysis results and strategic exploration guidance
6. **Structured Analysis Section**: The system must include a comprehensive analysis section with:
   - Project architecture and patterns identified from RAG searches
   - Key components and their relationships discovered through vector similarity
   - Entry points and critical paths found via semantic search
   - Code quality and complexity insights derived from indexed content
7. **Strategic Guidance Section**: The system must include actionable next steps and exploration recommendations
8. **Rich Metadata**: The system must include confidence scores, analysis timestamps, and source attribution for all findings

### Error Handling and Fallback Requirements

9. **Index Status Validation**: The system must check if the project is indexed before attempting RAG searches
10. **Graceful Degradation**: If RAG search fails, the system must provide clear guidance for indexing the project
11. **Partial Results Handling**: The system must handle cases where only partial project indexing exists
12. **Clear Error Messages**: The system must provide actionable error messages guiding users to resolve issues

### Performance Requirements

13. **Response Time**: The system must complete analysis within 30 seconds for projects with up to 10,000 indexed chunks
14. **Memory Efficiency**: The system must operate within existing memory constraints of the MCP server
15. **Concurrent Operations**: The system must handle multiple concurrent analysis requests without degradation

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time Code Analysis**: This feature will not perform live code parsing or analysis beyond what's already indexed
2. **Code Quality Scoring**: Advanced code quality metrics and scoring algorithms are not included
3. **Automated Refactoring Suggestions**: The tool will not provide specific code refactoring recommendations
4. **Cross-Project Comparison**: Comparing multiple projects or repositories is not included
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with the existing `explore_project` parameter interface is not required
6. **Live Indexing**: The tool will not trigger automatic indexing of unindexed projects

## Design Considerations

### User Interface
- Maintain the existing MCP prompt-based interface
- Structure output in clear, scannable sections with markdown formatting
- Include confidence indicators and data freshness timestamps
- Provide progressive disclosure with summary and detailed views

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing `search` tool functionality for RAG queries
- Integrate with `ProjectExplorationService` for enhanced static analysis
- Utilize `check_index_status` tool for validation
- Connect with existing error handling and logging infrastructure

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Must integrate with existing `search` MCP tool for RAG functionality
- Requires `qdrant_client` and embedding services to be operational
- Depends on project being previously indexed with intelligent chunking
- Should leverage existing `ProjectExplorationService` for supplementary analysis

### Architecture Changes
- Enhance `_register_explore_project()` function in `src/mcp_prompts.py`
- Modify `ProjectExplorationService` to integrate RAG search capabilities
- Add new search strategy classes for different analysis types (architecture, components, relationships)
- Implement result synthesis logic to combine RAG and static analysis

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement parallel search execution for different analysis aspects
- Cache frequently accessed project metadata
- Use batch search operations where possible
- Implement intelligent search query optimization

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
1. **Analysis Accuracy**: 90%+ accuracy in identifying correct project architecture patterns and key components
2. **User Satisfaction**: AI agents can successfully understand project context in first interaction
3. **Time to Understanding**: Reduce average project exploration time from 5+ minutes to under 1 minute

### Secondary Metrics
4. **Coverage Completeness**: Identify 95%+ of actual project entry points and core modules
5. **Error Rate**: <5% of analysis attempts result in errors or failures
6. **System Performance**: Maintain <30 second response times for 95% of requests

### Qualitative Metrics
7. **Developer Feedback**: Positive feedback on analysis depth and accuracy from both human developers and AI agents
8. **Exploration Efficiency**: Users report faster onboarding and better understanding of project structure

## Open Questions

1. **Search Query Optimization**: What specific search strategies will be most effective for different project types (web apps, libraries, CLI tools)?
2. **Result Ranking Algorithm**: How should we prioritize and rank multiple RAG search results when building the analysis?
3. **Cache Strategy**: Should we implement caching of analysis results for frequently explored projects?
4. **Incremental Updates**: How should the tool handle projects that have been partially re-indexed since last analysis?
5. **Customization Options**: Should users be able to specify analysis focus areas or depth levels?
6. **Integration Testing**: What specific test scenarios should we implement to validate RAG integration quality?
