### Usage Examples

#### Basic Failover Service Usage
```python
from src.services.cache_failover_service import get_cache_failover_service

# Get failover service
failover_service = await get_cache_failover_service()

# Register backup service
failover_service.register_failover_service(backup_cache_service)

# Use transparently - failover happens automatically
await failover_service.set("key", "value")
value = await failover_service.get("key")
```

#### Manual Failover Control
```python
# Trigger manual failover
event = await failover_service.manual_failover("Planned maintenance")
print(f"Failover successful: {event.success}")

# Check status
status = await failover_service.get_failover_status()
print(f"Current status: {status['status']}")

# Manual recovery
success = await failover_service.manual_recovery()
print(f"Recovery successful: {success}")
```

#### Health Monitoring
```python
# Add failover callback
def on_failover(event):
    print(f"Failover occurred: {event.trigger.value}")

failover_service.add_failover_callback(on_failover)

# Get health status
status = await failover_service.get_failover_status()
for service_id, health in status["service_health"].items():
    print(f"Service {service_id}: {health['health']}")
```

#### Configuration Management
```python
from src.tools.cache.cache_management import configure_cache_failover

# Configure failover behavior
config_result = await configure_cache_failover(
    enable_failover=True,
    health_check_interval_seconds=15,
    failure_threshold=2,
    recovery_threshold=5,
    auto_recovery_enabled=True,
