# Subtask 9.2.2 Completion Report

## Subtask: Add file system event handling for cache invalidation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2025-01-08
**Wave:** 9.0 - Cache Invalidation System

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented real-time file system event handling capabilities to complement the existing polling-based monitoring system, providing immediate response to file changes with native platform integration.

## Key Components Delivered

### 1. File System Event Handler Service (`src/services/file_system_event_handler.py`)
- **Real-time event monitoring** using Watchdog library for cross-platform support
- **Debouncing system** to prevent excessive invalidation from rapid file changes
- **Pattern-based filtering** for selective file monitoring based on project configurations
- **Event type mapping** from file system events to cache invalidation triggers
- **Statistics tracking** for monitoring event handler performance
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation when Watchdog is unavailable

### 2. Enhanced File Monitoring Service Integration
- **Multi-mode monitoring** supporting polling, events, hybrid, and disabled modes
- **Event service integration** with automatic callback registration
- **Project-specific event monitoring** with configurable patterns and debouncing
- **Seamless mode switching** between polling and event-based monitoring
- **Combined statistics** aggregating data from both polling and event sources

### 3. Event Handler Features
- **CacheInvalidationEventHandler** - Custom handler for file system events
- **Debouncing mechanism** - Prevents duplicate events within configurable intervals
- **Pattern matching** - Include/exclude file patterns for selective monitoring
- **Event mapping** - Converts file system events to monitoring events
- **Graceful error handling** - Continues operation despite individual event errors

### 4. Monitoring Mode Enhancements
- **EVENTS mode** - Pure real-time file system event monitoring
- **HYBRID mode** - Combination of polling and events for maximum coverage
- **POLLING mode** - Traditional polling-based monitoring only
- **DISABLED mode** - No monitoring (manual triggers only)

### 5. Dependency Management
- **Watchdog library integration** - Added to pyproject.toml dependencies
- **Optional dependency handling** - Graceful fallback when Watchdog unavailable
- **Cross-platform support** - Windows, macOS, Linux file system events
- **Version constraints** - Watchdog >=3.0.0,<4 for stability

## Technical Architecture

### Event Processing Flow
```
File System Change → Watchdog Observer → CacheInvalidationEventHandler →
Debouncing Logic → Pattern Filtering → Event Conversion →
Monitoring Event Queue → Cache Invalidation Processing
```

### Event Handler Architecture
```python
class CacheInvalidationEventHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    - Project-specific configuration
    - Pattern-based filtering (include/exclude)
    - Debouncing with configurable intervals
    - Event type mapping to monitoring events
    - Statistics tracking and error handling
```

### Integration Points
1. **FileSystemEventService** - Manages multiple project observers
2. **FileMonitoringService** - Integrates event handling with existing polling
3. **CacheInvalidationService** - Receives events for processing
4. **ProjectMonitoringConfig** - Configures patterns and debouncing

### Debouncing System
- **Configurable intervals** (default: 100ms) to prevent event floods
- **Per-file tracking** of last event times
- **Pending event management** with cancellable async tasks
- **Batch consolidation** of multiple rapid changes to same file

## Event Types Supported

### File System Events
- **CREATED** - New files added to monitored directories
- **MODIFIED** - Existing files changed
- **DELETED** - Files removed from monitored directories
- **MOVED** - Files moved/renamed (handled as delete + create)
- **Directory events** - Directory creation/deletion/modification

### Event Mapping
- File system events mapped to monitoring events
- Integration with existing invalidation reason system
- Metadata preservation for debugging and analysis

## Configuration Features

### Project-Specific Event Monitoring
```python
await event_service.start_monitoring(
    project_name="my-project",
    root_directory="/path/to/project",
    file_patterns=["*.py", "*.js", "*.ts"],
    exclude_patterns=["*.pyc", "node_modules/*"],
    recursive=True,
    debounce_interval=0.1
)
```

### Monitoring Mode Control
```python
# Pure event-based monitoring
monitoring_service.set_monitoring_mode(MonitoringMode.EVENTS)

# Hybrid polling + events
monitoring_service.set_monitoring_mode(MonitoringMode.HYBRID)
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Debouncing Benefits
- **Reduced invalidation overhead** by consolidating rapid changes
- **Configurable intervals** for different project requirements
- **Per-file tracking** prevents cross-file interference
- **Async task management** for efficient resource usage

### 2. Pattern Filtering
- **Early filtering** reduces processing overhead
- **Include/exclude patterns** for precise control
- **File type optimization** avoids monitoring irrelevant files
- **Directory exclusions** prevent monitoring large node_modules, etc.

### 3. Resource Management
- **Observer lifecycle management** with proper cleanup
- **Task cancellation** for pending debounce operations
- **Memory efficient** event tracking and statistics
- **Graceful shutdown** with timeout handling

## Error Handling and Resilience

### 1. Library Availability
- **Optional Watchdog dependency** with graceful fallback
- **Availability detection** and status reporting
- **Platform compatibility checks** for supported systems
- **Fallback to polling** when events unavailable

### 2. Event Processing Errors
- **Individual event error isolation** - one failed event doesn't stop monitoring
- **Error statistics tracking** for monitoring health
- **Retry mechanisms** for transient failures
- **Logging integration** for debugging and analysis

### 3. Service Integration
- **Callback error handling** - errors in invalidation don't stop monitoring
- **Service initialization robustness** with proper error propagation
- **Shutdown safety** with timeout-based cleanup
- **State consistency** during mode changes

## Statistics and Monitoring

### Event Handler Statistics
```python
{
    "total_events": 150,
    "processed_events": 142,
    "filtered_events": 8,
    "error_events": 0,
    "events_by_type": {

        "FILE_DELETED": 22
    },
    "last_event_time": "2025-01-08T10:30:45Z"
}
```

    "watchdog_available": true,
