# Task 14.2.1 Completion Report: Cache Corruption Detection and Recovery

## Task Summary
**Task:** 14.2.1 Add cache corruption detection and recovery
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Completion Date:** 2025-07-12
**Wave:** 14.0 Error Handling and Resilience

## Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive cache corruption detection and recovery system that provides:

### 1. Corruption Detection Framework (`cache_corruption_detector.py`)

#### Multi-layered Detection System
- **ChecksumCorruptionDetector**: Validates data integrity using MD5 checksums
- **SerializationCorruptionDetector**: Tests JSON/pickle serialization round-trips
- **TypeCorruptionDetector**: Verifies data type consistency with metadata
- **StructureCorruptionDetector**: Validates data structure integrity and detects circular references

#### Corruption Types Detected
- Serialization errors
- Checksum mismatches
- Format invalid data
- Encoding errors
- Truncated data
- Metadata corruption
- Type mismatches
- Invalid structures

### 2. Automated Recovery Engine

#### Recovery Strategies
- **DELETE**: Remove corrupted data
- **REGENERATE**: Recompute from source
- **RESTORE_FROM_BACKUP**: Restore from backup storage
- **REPAIR_IN_PLACE**: Attempt in-place repairs
- **QUARANTINE**: Isolate for analysis
- **SKIP**: Continue without action

#### Intelligent Recovery Selection
- Severity-based action determination
- Corruption type-specific strategies
- Configurable recovery policies
- Automatic backup before recovery

### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring

#### Real-time Metrics
- Total scans and items scanned
- Corruption counts by type and severity
- Recovery success/failure rates
- Performance metrics (scan time, check time)
- Recent corruption activity

#### Configurable Scanning
- Periodic automatic scanning
- Batch processing with concurrency limits
- Timeout protection
- Performance optimization

### 4. System Integration Features

#### Configuration Options
```python
@dataclass
class CorruptionConfig:
    # Detection settings
    enabled: bool = True
    scan_interval: float = 3600.0  # 1 hour
    batch_size: int = 100

    # Verification settings
    verify_checksums: bool = True
    verify_serialization: bool = True
    verify_data_types: bool = True
    verify_data_structure: bool = True

    # Recovery settings
    auto_recovery_enabled: bool = True
    max_recovery_attempts: int = 3
    quarantine_enabled: bool = True
```

#### Alert System
- Corruption threshold monitoring
