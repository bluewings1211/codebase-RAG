### Frequency Factor Calculation Algorithm

**Base Algorithm:**
```python
# Calculate relative frequency
relative_frequency = call_count / total_calls_in_file

# Apply logarithmic scaling
scaled_frequency = log(1 + relative_frequency * scale_factor * 10)

# Convert to multiplier with bounds
frequency_factor = clamp(1.0 + scaled_frequency, min_multiplier, max_multiplier)
```

   - Normalized cycle representation
   - Dependency loop detection

3. **Hotspot Analysis**:
   - High-frequency target identification
   - Call type pattern recognition
   - Async pattern detection
   - Cross-module pattern analysis

### Statistical Frequency Metrics

**Implemented Statistics:**
- Min/Max/Mean/Median frequency
- Standard deviation calculation
- Quartile analysis (Q1, Q3)
- Outlier identification (Z-score > threshold)

**Frequency Recommendations:**
```python
# Percentile-based factor assignment
if freq >= p90: factor = 1.5 + bonus
elif freq >= p75: factor = 1.2 + bonus
elif freq >= p50: factor = 1.1 + bonus
else: factor = 1.0
```
