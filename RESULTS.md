## Technical Changes Summary

### Package Manager Migration
- **Before**: Poetry-based dependency management
- **After**: uv-based modern Python package management
- **Impact**: Faster installation, simpler commands, better developer experience

### Documentation Architecture
- **Before**: Single large README.md file
- **After**: Structured documentation with dedicated files
  - `README.md`: User-focused getting started guide
  - `CLAUDE.md`: Developer reference and project instructions
  - `docs/MCP_TOOLS.md`: Comprehensive tool documentation
  - `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md`: Optimization and workflow guides

### IDE Integration Focus
- **Before**: Manual server setup and management
- **After**: Seamless IDE integration workflows
- **Supported IDEs**: Claude Code (active), Gemini CLI (planned), VS Code (planned)

### Language Support Documentation
- **Updated**: Accurate reflection of 8 fully implemented languages
- **Removed**: Outdated "Phase 1/Phase 2" categorization
- **Added**: Detailed feature support for each language

## File Changes

### Modified Files
1. **`CLAUDE.md`**: Complete modernization (298 lines)
2. **`README.md`**: Comprehensive update focusing on user experience
3. **`tasks/tasks-prd-documentation-modernization.md`**: All tasks marked complete

### New Files Created
1. **`docs/MCP_TOOLS.md`**: Complete tool reference (681 lines)
2. **`docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md`**: Optimization and workflow guide (573 lines)
3. **`../progress/documentation-modernization-1.json`**: Progress tracking file

### Directory Structure Added
```
docs/
├── MCP_TOOLS.md          # Comprehensive tool reference
└── BEST_PRACTICES.md     # Optimization guides
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start with uv
```bash
# Old workflow (Poetry)
poetry install
poetry shell
python src/run_mcp.py

# New workflow (uv)
uv sync
uv run python src/run_mcp.py
```

### IDE Registration
```bash
# Claude Code integration
claude mcp add codebase-rag-mcp \
  --command "uv" \
  --args "run" \
  --args "python" \
  --args "src/run_mcp.py"
```

### Documentation Navigation
```bash
# Quick tool reference
cat docs/MCP_TOOLS.md

# Optimization guides
cat docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md

# Developer instructions
cat CLAUDE.md
```

## Benefits Achieved
