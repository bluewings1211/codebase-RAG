# Subtask 9.1.4 Completion Report: Implement Partial Invalidation for Incremental Updates

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive partial invalidation functionality for incremental updates in the cache invalidation service. This enhancement provides granular cache invalidation capabilities that significantly improve performance by avoiding unnecessary cache clearing.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. New Invalidation Types and Enums
- **IncrementalInvalidationType**: Defines different types of partial invalidation
  - `CONTENT_BASED`: Based on actual content changes
  - `CHUNK_BASED`: Based on specific chunk changes
  - `METADATA_ONLY`: Only metadata changed
  - `DEPENDENCY_BASED`: Based on dependency changes
  - `HYBRID`: Combination of multiple types

- **Enhanced InvalidationReason**: Added new reasons for partial invalidation
  - `PARTIAL_CONTENT_CHANGE`: For content-based partial changes
  - `CHUNK_MODIFIED`: For chunk-level modifications
  - `METADATA_ONLY_CHANGE`: For metadata-only changes

### 2. PartialInvalidationResult Data Class
- Comprehensive result structure for partial invalidation analysis
- Tracks affected chunks, cache keys, and optimization metrics
- Includes content changes and dependency analysis
- Provides optimization ratio calculation (preserved vs invalidated keys)

### 3. Enhanced InvalidationEvent
- Added `partial_result` field to track partial invalidation details
- Extended metadata to include optimization information
- Improved serialization with partial invalidation data

### 4. Updated InvalidationStats
- Added tracking for partial invalidations
- Includes preserved keys count and optimization ratio metrics
- Enhanced statistics for performance monitoring

### 5. Core Partial Invalidation Methods

#### `partial_invalidate_file_caches()`
- Main entry point for partial invalidation
- Supports content-based analysis with old/new content comparison
- Includes fallback to full invalidation on errors
- Provides comprehensive event logging and statistics

#### `register_chunk_mapping()`
- Enables chunk-level invalidation tracking
- Maps file paths to code chunks for granular analysis
- Maintains content hashes for change detection
- Supports cache key dependency mapping per chunk

#### `invalidate_specific_chunks()`
- Targeted invalidation of specific chunks within a file
- Preserves unmodified chunks and their cache entries
- Provides chunk-level invalidation events and statistics

### 6. Advanced Analysis Methods

#### `_analyze_partial_invalidation()`
- Comprehensive content analysis for optimal invalidation strategy
- Supports multiple analysis modes: metadata, content, and chunk-based
- Automatically selects best strategy based on available data

#### `_analyze_chunk_based_invalidation()`
- Deep chunk-level analysis using Tree-sitter parsing
- Identifies specific changed chunks between file versions
- Calculates precise optimization ratios for chunk preservation

#### `_analyze_content_based_invalidation()`
- Content similarity analysis for intelligent invalidation
- Tiered invalidation based on similarity thresholds
- Preserves cache entries for high-similarity content

#### `_analyze_metadata_based_invalidation()`
- Conservative invalidation for metadata-only changes
- Preserves embeddings when only file metadata changes
- Optimizes for minimal cache disruption

### 7. Optimization and Performance Features

#### Content Similarity Calculation
- Line-based similarity analysis between old and new content
- Intelligent threshold-based invalidation decisions
- Preserves valuable cache entries when possible

#### Chunk Change Detection
- Signature-based chunk comparison
- Content hash verification for change detection
- Handles added, modified, and deleted chunks

#### Targeted Cache Key Generation
- Chunk-specific cache key generation
- Function and class-level key mapping
- Service-aware key organization

## Technical Enhancements

### 1. Instance Variable Additions
```python
# Partial invalidation tracking
self._chunk_cache_map: dict[str, set[str]] = {}  # file_path -> chunk_ids
self._chunk_dependency_map: dict[str, set[str]] = {}  # chunk_id -> cache_keys
self._content_hashes: dict[str, dict[str, str]] = {}  # file_path -> {chunk_id: hash}
self._metadata_hashes: dict[str, str] = {}  # file_path -> metadata_hash
```

### 2. Advanced Cache Key Management
- Chunk-specific key generation for granular invalidation
- Service-aware key routing for targeted operations
- Dependency mapping for cascade invalidation optimization

### 3. Optimization Ratio Tracking
- Measures efficiency of partial vs full invalidation
- Provides performance metrics for cache optimization
- Enables data-driven invalidation strategy tuning
