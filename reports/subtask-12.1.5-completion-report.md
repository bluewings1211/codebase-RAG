**Task:** Implement memory-aware cache warmup strategies
**Wave:** 12.0 - Memory Management Integration
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED
**Completion Date:** 2025-07-09

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive memory-aware cache warmup strategies that intelligently preload cache data based on available memory, memory pressure, and historical usage patterns. The implementation provides multiple warmup strategies with adaptive memory budget allocation and coordination with the existing memory management system.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Cache Warmup Service (`src/services/cache_warmup_service.py`)

**Core Features:**
- **Memory-Aware Warmup Planning**: Dynamic warmup plan generation based on available memory and system pressure
- **Multiple Warmup Strategies**:
  - Aggressive: Uses 80% of available memory for maximum preloading
  - Balanced: Uses 60% with moderate preloading based on usage patterns
  - Conservative: Uses 20% with minimal preloading of only critical items
  - Adaptive: Dynamically adjusts based on conditions
  - Priority-based: Focuses on highest priority items only

**Key Classes:**
- `WarmupItem`: Individual warmup item with priority, size estimation, and usage frequency
- `WarmupPlan`: Comprehensive warmup plan with phases and memory budget
- `WarmupProgress`: Real-time progress tracking during warmup execution
- `CacheWarmupService`: Main service coordinating all warmup operations

**Memory Integration:**
- Memory pressure monitoring integration
- Real-time memory usage tracking
- Adaptive memory budget calculations
- Memory event tracking for warmup operations

### 2. Cache Warmup Utilities (`src/utils/cache_warmup_utils.py`)

**Utility Functions:**
- `calculate_memory_budget()`: Smart memory budget calculation based on strategy and pressure
- `estimate_item_memory_usage()`: Accurate memory estimation for different data types
- `create_warmup_item()`: Standardized warmup item creation with metadata
- `prioritize_warmup_items()`: Intelligent item prioritization based on strategy

## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Budget Algorithm
```python
def calculate_memory_budget(available_memory_mb, strategy, pressure_level):
    base_budgets = {
        AGGRESSIVE: 0.8,      # 80% of available memory
        BALANCED: 0.6,        # 60% of available memory
        CONSERVATIVE: 0.2,    # 20% of available memory
    }

    pressure_adjustments = {
        CRITICAL: 0.0,        # No warmup
        HIGH: 0.2,           # 20% of base
        MODERATE: 0.6,       # 60% of base
        LOW: 1.0,            # 100% of base
    }

    budget = available_memory_mb * base_budgets[strategy] * pressure_adjustments[pressure_level]
    return max(budget, 10.0) if pressure_level != CRITICAL else 0.0
```

### Warmup Item Prioritization
Items are prioritized using a composite score that considers:
- Priority level (1-10 scale)
- Historical usage frequency
- Warmup cost/time
- Recency of access
- Dependencies between items

- Adaptive strategy recommendation based on system state
- Dynamic warmup termination on memory pressure escalation
- Memory event tracking for all warmup operations

## Integration Points

### Memory Management System
- Seamless integration with existing memory tracking in `memory_utils.py`
- Memory pressure callback registration for warmup termination
- Cache memory event tracking for warmup operations
- Coordination with garbage collection service

### Cache Services
- Standardized warmup interface for all cache services
- Historical data collection for intelligent candidate generation
- Memory usage estimation for accurate budget planning
- Warmup statistics for performance monitoring

### Performance Monitoring
- Warmup progress tracking with real-time updates
- Memory usage monitoring during warmup execution

    memory_budget_mb=500.0
)
```

### Custom Warmup Plan
```python
from src.services.cache_warmup_service import get_cache_warmup_service

service = await get_cache_warmup_service()
plan = await service.create_warmup_plan(WarmupStrategy.AGGRESSIVE)
results = await service.execute_warmup_plan(plan)
```

### Warmup Status Monitoring
```python
status = await service.get_warmup_status()
if status["active"]:
    progress = status["progress"]
    print(f"Warmup progress: {progress['progress_percent']:.1f}%")
```
