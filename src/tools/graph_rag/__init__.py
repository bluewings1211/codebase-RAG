"""Graph RAG MCP Tools

This module provides Graph RAG functionality through MCP tools, enabling
users to leverage advanced code structure analysis, pattern recognition,
and cross-project search capabilities.

Tools provided:
- graph_analyze_structure: Analyze structural relationships of specific breadcrumbs
- graph_find_similar_implementations: Find similar implementations across projects
- graph_identify_patterns: Identify architectural patterns in code
- trace_function_chain: Trace function call chains and implementation flows
- find_function_path: Find optimal paths between two functions
- analyze_project_chains: Analyze function chains across entire projects
